""" Alice is working on a data analysis task and wants to process a matrix of integers. She needs to calculate the product of all elements in rows that consist only of even numbers. If no such rows exist, a specific message should be displayed. 



Help Alice write a program to perform this task using a pass statement.



Example:

Input: 

3

2 4 

1 3

6 8



Output: 

384



Explanation:

Row 1: [2, 4] contains only even numbers. Product = 2 * 4 = 8.

Row 2: [1, 3] contains odd numbers. Skipped using the pass.

Row 3: [6, 8] contains only even numbers. Product = 6 * 8 = 48.

Final Product = 8 * 48 = 384.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer row, representing the number of rows in the matrix.

The next row lines consist of space-separated integers, representing the elements of each row in the matrix.

Output format :
If at least one row contains only even numbers, the program prints the product of all elements in such rows.

If no rows with only even numbers are found, the program prints the message: No rows with only even numbers found.

rows = int(input())
matrix = []
for _ in range(rows):
    row = list(map(int, input().split()))
    matrix.append(row)
final_product = 1
for row in matrix:
    has_odd = False
    for num in row:
        if num % 2 != 0:
            has_odd = True

            break
    if not has_odd:
        for num in row:
            final_product *= num

if final_product == 1:

    print(final_product)
